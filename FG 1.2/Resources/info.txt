Welcome to ''FightingGame'', a simple turn-based combat game set in a generic mediaeval/fantasy setting.

Here, your character will fight against his enemies in search of loot and power, to become the strongest foe in the Realm. Or so they say.

To fight your opponent, you can Attack them with your weapon, or use one of the items that you carry in the Inventory. Once (and if) you manage to slay them, you'll be able to choose one weapon or armor to improve your chances of defeating stronger opponents, and you'll also gain some more items and upgrade the ones you already have stored in the Inventory.

So go forth and have no fear, slay the king and return VICTORIOUS!
